# CameraUnloader
This program is meant for me to unload all my camera files and have them organized in a way that I could edit them with my existing workflow.

This program depedns on tkinter, shutil, os, and glob. The program uses a GUI to interact with the user. Once the user selects a folder, the glob will detect the files inside the directory and organize them by extension. Then, each filetype will gain a folder and all assosiated files will be moved to that folder. Finally, the additional organizational folders that I personally use for my photograph workflow are made.
